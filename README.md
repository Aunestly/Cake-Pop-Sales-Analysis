## Background
Background: 

The local cake pop business started as an independent in-house bakery 2018. In October of 2022, the local cake pop business opened its first physical location. The business started off with a fixed price for each cake pop but later began to offer promotional deals. The cake pop business has six main menu items, and one specialty item per month. For the month of 3/28-4/28/23, they produced an average of fifty batches of cake pops (CPs). Fifty batches of CPs are around six hundred cake pops a month. For the month of 3/28-4/28/23 they earned $5,184.25 in cake pop sales compared to $13,000 in December 2022. Total average cost of expenses per month, located in the Budget Report is $678.53 and $2,000 booth rent.  This leaves Stakeholders with only about $2,500 to split 50/50, for one month. Although the local cake pop business garnered loyal customers, they did not completely understand the importance of their sales data.
